# Tech 258 - Python

## What is Python?
Python is a widely used high-level programming language.
Python emphasises code readability and allows for programmers to express concepts in fewer liens of code.<br>
Python was designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by the Python Software Foundation.
It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied 
during Christmas

You can download the latest version of Python [Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Why is Python Popular
Python is widely regarded as the most suitable beginning language for those who want to learn programming.
This is because the code reads a lot like everyday English.
Additionally, Python is so widely used because of its adaptability. Python has so many different applications in the IT
industry. <br>
Here are some examples:
* Web Development
* Machine Learning
* Desktop GUI Development
* Data Science

#### Why is Python particularly popular for DevOps engineers?
In the DevOps engineer role, there is a key emphasis on automation. Python is an incredible tool for automating processes.
Python can automate small day-to-day tests, but can also be used to automate application deployment.
*The possibilities are endless.*

## What is a virtual environment or 'venv'?
A venv is a module that supports lightweight virtual environments. It is used in Python to allow for the installation
and inclusion of different packages and Python interpreters to the user's "base" Python.
## What is pip?
PIP is a package manager for Python packages.<br>
PIP is installed by default in Python version 3.4 and later.<br>

**To check which version of PIP is installed, enter the following command into your terminal:**
```shell
C:\Users\Your Name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts>pip --version
```

## What is scripting?
Scripting allows the user to make a program or application perform a specific function.
#### How is scripting different to programming?
All scripting languages are programming languages, however not all programming languages are scripting languages.
This is because scripting languages are required to be compiled, while programming languages do not need this extra step.

## What are the base/in-built Python libraries?
* Random
  * Allows you to generate pseudo-random numbers

  * Allows you to read and write to CSV files.
## What are some of the most popular external Python libraries?
* NumPy
